The gas was given its name hydro-gen, meaning water-former, by Antoine Lavoisier.In 1931, Harold Urey and his colleagues at Columbia University in the US detected a second, rarer, form of hydrogen.

A more dangerous form of arsenic, called white arsenic, has also been long known. This was the trioxide, As2O3, and was a by-product of copper refining. When this was mixed with olive oil and heated it yielded arsenic metal itself. The discovery of the element arsenic is attributed to Albertus Magnus in the 1200s.");
